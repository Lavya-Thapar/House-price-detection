# House-price-detection
The above model predicts the price of a house, given a lot of input features of a house. It uses the california housing dataset present in the sklearn.datasets library 
and the model is based on XGBoost regressor,where weak learners (typically decision trees) are combined to create a strong learner. It builds a series of trees sequentially, where each tree tries to correct the errors made by the previous one.
